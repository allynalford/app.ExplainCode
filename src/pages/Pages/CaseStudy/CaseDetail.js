                  <h2 className="my-4">Python object-oriented programming</h2>
                  <p className="text mt-4">
                    Python is an object-oriented programming language. This
                    means that everything in Python is an object, and every
                    object has a specific purpose. Classes are one of the ways
                    that objects are defined in Python. A class is like a
                    template for creating objects. It is a blueprint that
                    defines the attributes and methods of an object.
                  </p>
                  <p className="text mt-4">
                    In Python, everything is an object. This includes numbers,
                    strings, lists, tuples, dictionaries, and even functions.
                    All of these objects have a specific purpose. For example, a
                    string is an object that represents a sequence of
                    characters. A list is an object that represents a sequence
                    of values. A dictionary is an object that represents a
                    mapping of keys to values.
                  </p>
                  <h3 className="my-4">Python object attributes and methods</h3>
                  <p className="text mt-4">
                    Each object has a specific set of attributes and methods.
                    Attributes are the data that an object contains. Methods are
                    the functions that an object can perform. For example, a
                    string has the attributes of length and contents. The
                    methods of a string include upper, lower, and split.
                  </p>
                  <h3 className="my-4">Python classes</h3>
                  <p className="text mt-4">
                    Classes are important in Python because they allow you to
                    create your own objects. You can define a class that
                    represents a specific type of object, such as a car or a
                    person. You can then create objects of that class. Each
                    object will have the attributes and methods that you defined
                    in the class.
                  </p>
                  <p className="text mt-4">
                    Creating a class is simple in Python. You just use the
                    keyword class, followed by the name of the class. For
                    example, you could create a class called Car.
                  </p>
                  <p className="text mt-4">
                    Once you have defined a class, you can create objects of
                    that class. To create an object, you use the keyword class,
                    followed by the name of the class, followed by the keyword
                    object. For example, you could create an object of the Car
                    class like this:
                  </p>
                  <p className="text mt-4">
                    <pre>
                      <code>car = Car()</code>
                    </pre>
                  </p>
                  <p className="text mt-4">
                    This would create an object of the Car class. You can then
                    access the attributes and methods of the object using the
                    dot notation.
